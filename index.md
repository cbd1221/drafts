# about dr@fts

**dr@fts** is a lightweight iOS application for all your text-based needs. Simple, fast, and intuitive. 
The application is designed to be used offline, it does not collect any data, and allows your thoughts to remain
private until you choose to share them with others — regardless of the platform you choose to share them on

## another text editor?

> Why can't I save my thread? <br>
> I accidentally sent that text before I was ready <br>
> Our wifi went down and I lost all of my work! <br>

I heard all of these complaints when my partner downloaded _threads_ and realized there wasn't a simple "draft" feature. This 
application isn't designed to be a one stop shop for all your text-based needs. 
<br><br>
It solves a small, yet extremely annoying problem. 
Users are able to select from a variety of social media platforms which will allow them to view their current character count in 
realtime and the maximum character count allowed for that platform. 

## features

* _I always forget to mention this — FREE_  
  * ad free too!
* realtime character countE
* platform specific character limits 
* * you can exceed these in-app in order to better edit your thoughts
* support for emojis, glyphs, etc
* save up to 10 dr@fts at a single time — make space as you see fit
* **Privacy** - this can't be emphasized enough. <br>
All of your thoughts are store locally on your device and remian private until you choose to change that

## Upcoming Features

* support for custom character limits
* manual adding of selectable platforms with custom character limits _(no one isn't intimidated by a 5 page text message)_
* support for images/videos, and audio files
* markdown support
* support for sharing directly to social media platforms 
* * assuming I can make that work in a way that is intuitive and easy to use
