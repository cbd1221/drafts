# dr@fts
an ios application that allows users to easily draft posts from some of the most popular social media sites, complete with platform specific character counts/limits

# about dr@fts

**dr@fts** is a lightweight iOS application for all your text-based needs. Simple, fast, and intuitive.
The application is designed to be used offline, it does not collect any data, and allows your thoughts to remain
private until you choose to share them with others — regardless of the platform you choose to share them on
**all of your dr@fts are stored locally on your device, ensuring privacy and accessibility at all times**

# another text editor?

> Why can't I save my thread? <br>
> I accidentally sent that text before I was ready <br>
> Our wifi went down and I lost all of my work! <br>

I heard all of these complaints when my partner downloaded _threads_ and realized there wasn't a simple "draft" feature. This
application isn't designed to be a one stop shop for all your text-based needs.

================

It solves a small, yet extremely annoying problem.
Users are able to select from a variety of social media platforms which will allow them to view their current character count in
realtime and the maximum character count allowed for that platform.

# features

* _I always forget to mention this — FREE_  
  * ad free too!
* realtime character counts

  * you can exceed these in-app in order to better edit your thoughts
